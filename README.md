# AlarmFade

This is an mobile Substrate Tweak for Jailbroken iOS Devices on iOS 12.  
This tweak can fade in the sound of the alarm and timer. The duration of the fade-in and the volume where
the fade-in should be capped can be configured by the users.

Was made in a time where no alarm fade tweak was available, so I thought a give it a shot. 
It's relased in the BigBoss Repo: http://apt.thebigboss.org/onepackage.php?bundleid=com.exormeter.alarmfade&db=
